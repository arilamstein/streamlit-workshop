# streamlit-workshop

Code and slides for an introductory workshop on Streamlit. The course is split into four sessions, and is intended to run over two 3-hour sessions.

Throughout the course there is an emphasis on using LLMs to improve productivity.

## ðŸ“Š Course Overview: Building Interactive Data Apps with Streamlit
This course guides learners through the full lifecycle of building a Streamlit appâ€”from setup to deploymentâ€”using U.S. Census data as a case study. The skills taught are broadly applicable to any dataset, making this a versatile foundation for civic tech, data journalism, and beyond.

## ðŸ§­ Module Breakdown
### 1. Introduction & Setup 
Learners get oriented with Streamlit and the course structure. This module walks through local setup, introduces the app they'll build, and provides a gentle onboarding path to ensure everyone can follow alongâ€”regardless of prior experience.

### 2. Inputs & Graphics 
The heart of the course. Students learn how to add interactive widgets (like dropdowns and sliders) and create dynamic visualizations. By the end of this module, theyâ€™ll be able to build simple, responsive apps that let users explore data visually.

### 3. Organizing UI and Code 
This module introduces layout tools (columns and tabs) to improve user experience, and shows how to split code into separate files for UI and data logic. Itâ€™s all about clarity, maintainability, and empathy for future collaborators.

### 4. Deployment 
Learners discover how to share their app with the worldâ€”without needing command-line GitHub access. The module walks through a secure, beginner-friendly deployment workflow using GitHubâ€™s web interface.
