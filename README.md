# streamlit-workshop
Code and slides for an introductory Streamlit workshop, designed to run over two 3-hour sessions. The course is split into four modules and includes hands-on exercises and tips for using large language models (LLMs) to support development.

## ðŸ§  Prerequisites
This workshop assumes learners are comfortable with:
  * Navigating the command line
  * Using Git (clone, commit, push)
  * Writing Python code (scripts and Jupyter notebooks)

## ðŸ“Š Course Overview: Building Interactive Data Apps with Streamlit
This course walks learners through the full lifecycle of building a Streamlit appâ€”from setup to deploymentâ€”using U.S. Census data as a case study. The skills taught are broadly applicable to any dataset, making this a versatile foundation for scientists, data journalists, and beyond.

## ðŸ§­ Module Breakdown
### 1. Introduction & Setup
Get oriented with Streamlit and the course structure. This module walks through local setup, introduces the app you'll build, and provides a gentle onboarding path to ensure everyone can follow alongâ€”regardless of prior experience.

### 2. Inputs & Graphics
The heart of the course. Learn how to add interactive widgets (like dropdowns and sliders) and create dynamic visualizations. By the end of this module, you'll be able to build simple, responsive apps that let users explore data visually.

### 3. Organizing UI and Code
Improve user experience with layout tools like columns and tabs, and learn how to split code into separate files for UI and data logic. This module emphasizes clarity, maintainability, and empathy for future collaborators.

### 4. Deployment
Share your app with the world. This module walks through a secure, beginner-friendly deployment workflow using GitHubâ€™s web interface.
